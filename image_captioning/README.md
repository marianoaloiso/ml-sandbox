## Image Captioning

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks exploring various models and techniques used for image captioning

**Notebooks:**

* **Show And Tell.ipynb:** This notebook delves into the **Show and Tell** model, a pioneering deep learning approach for image captioning introduced in 2015. It explores how the model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder to extract image features and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) decoder to generate textual descriptions.

**Test Images:**

The `images` subdirectory contains a set of test images that can be used to evaluate the performance of the explored image testing models.
